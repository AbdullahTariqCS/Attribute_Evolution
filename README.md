The Evolution Simulator project in C++ is a simulation endeavor aiming to emulate the
evolution of entites in a two-dimensional space. The project incorporates a multifaceted
architecture encompassing several key components to create a dynamic and engaging
simulation. It aims to model the interactioon between a population of predators and prey,
simulating the movement of both, the grass ea∆üng behavior of prey and hunting of prey by
predators.
